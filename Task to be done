How do I follow a user on Spoj for solving problems? (Refer Details).
I can view the questions solved by a user but they are not chronologically arranged. How do I proceed to solve problems by a specific user in increasing order of difficulty?
/*	
		Current approach 
			
			1) Read file using fopen
			2) Check for regex Match
			3) Create a new file based on Regex
			4) Chrome - open the file
